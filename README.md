# hello-world
I'm a 37 year old male born and raised in Boyd County, KY now living with my wife of 12+years in Lexington, KY.
I've always been very interested in computers and technology, but never had the commitment and focus to learn the programming side of the hardware. I'm hoping this course will help me learn and hopefully lead me to a new career.
